# MazeGame with Basic AI

This is my first project combining game development and AI.  
- **Game**: Terminal-based maze game with traps and coins.  
- **AI**: Currently running Genetic Algorithm. Later repos will include NEAT and PPO.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `GameCode/play_maze.py` to play manually  
3. AI scripts will live in `MazeAI/`
4. Run AI from root with "python -m MazeAI.GA.ga_agent" -> Havent tested args. But more to come
